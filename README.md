# Extra example applications for Mapbender

This is a bunch of YAML files that define extended Mapbender demo applications for testing / showing off certain
features beyond the simple
[Mapbender Users / Mapbender Mobile demo applications shippping with Mapbender Starter](https://github.com/mapbender/mapbender-starter/tree/release/3.0.6/application/app/config/applications).

You can copy or symlink them them into your [Mapbender Starter](https://github.com/mapbender/mapbender-starter)'s
application/app/config/applications directory to immediately make them available.

We recommend you [download the zipball](https://github.com/mapbender/extra-example-apps/archive/master.zip). There
is currently no mechanism and no plan to add these files via composer or otherwise embed them into Mapbender Starter
directly.

Some / many applications may only work internally on the Wheregroup network.
